A teacher wants to create several sets of pairs of her students to work together on class projects; over the several sets, each student should be paired with each other student only once. For instance, with four students, there are three sets of pairings:

`{Anne, Beth}, {Chet, Dirk}
{Anne, Chet}, {Beth, Dirk}
{Anne, Dirk}, {Beth, Chet}`

Your task is to write a program that, given a list of students, produces a list of all possible sets of pairings, without duplicates. When you are finished, you are welcome to read or run a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.
